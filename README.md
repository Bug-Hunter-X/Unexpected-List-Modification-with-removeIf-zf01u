This example demonstrates an uncommon error in Kotlin related to the use of the `removeIf` function on mutable lists. The `removeIf` function modifies the list in place, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the original list is used elsewhere in the code after calling `removeIf`. The solution shows how to use `filter` to create a new list without modifying the original one.
